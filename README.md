This app converts English to Pig Latin,let's see how :

Pig Latin is a constructed language game in which words in English are altered according to a simple set of rules. Pig Latin takes the first consonant (or consonant cluster) of an English word, moves it to the end of the word and suffixes an ay. For example, pig yields igpay, banana yields ananabay, and trash yields ashtray or rashtay (dependent on location/preferences). The objective is to conceal the meaning of the words from others not familiar with the rules. The reference to Latin is a deliberate misnomer, as it is simply a form of jargon, used only for its English connotations as a strange and foreign-sounding language.
